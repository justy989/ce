todo:
- add config option for log destination (we want to init the log before the user config, so can we even do this?)
- dired mode
- undo in macros actually removing some actions
- vim ctrl+w HJKL to move windows around
- regex replace for captures
- vim's 'gf'
- customization:
  - status bar
- backup files, and session info in ~/.ce
- vim :sort
- log file of multiple ce's at once will have problems

bug:
- sometimes chain undo will undo 2 actions, not sure how to reproduce yet
- TERM=xterm-256color needs to be set to view ce correctly
- sometimes in the terminal, arrow keys stop being interpreted normally and they cause weird actions to happen
- crash where assertion fails when vim last action is verb_last_action
- highlighting trailing whitespace doesn't work in multiline strings in python
- logging from different threads creates problems
