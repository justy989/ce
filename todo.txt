todo:
- multiple terminals
- add config option for log destination (we want to init the log before the user config, so can we even do this?)
- dired mode
- message box

bug:
- slow to start, wtf
- occasional blinking garbage when drawing (really stumped on this one!)
- 'man fwrite' crashes in the terminal
- resizing with terminal on screen crashes sometimes
- 'Si]' substitutes over the last bracket if the cursor is on it [check it out]
- 'man' commands that don't crash have broken scrolling
