# ce: a c language terminal editor

### But why?
- Emacs and Vim are awesome, but they have some problems we'd like to address without having to learn/write
  vimscript or emacs lisp. However, we want to take some awesome ideas from each:
  - Emacs's idea where everything is a just a plain text buffer. We get a familiar and common interface for
    all buffer types and can copy+paste from anywhere (even the terminal)
  - Vim's modal editting. We really like it! It also makes the transition to using ce easier.
    (Note: the default configuration implements vim-like editting)
- The config is written in the C programming language and compiled into a shared object that you can reload
  while running. No need to learn a new language!
- Registers in vim are awesome, but it's not easy to see what you have in registers or even know what
  registers are occupied. In ce, you have info buffers '[marks]', '[macros]', '[yanks]' to show what you have
  in each register.
- Search in vim/emacs with regular expressions is awesome, but each have a special implementation of regexes
  with special syntax in certain cases. We just want to use the c standard library's regex implementation, so we
  don't have to remember special rules. We also support plain search.
- Macros in vim are awesome, but:
  - If you mess up while creating a macro, you have to start over. In ce, when you are viewing your recorded macros,
    you can select any macro to edit it
- Syntax Highlighting in emacs and vim are done and extended using regexes, which are not great to read. In ce,
  a c interface is provided for custom syntax highlighting. See ce_syntax.h for examples.
- When using the terminal, there is often output with file and line numbers (compiler errors, greps, etc) that we
  would like to easily scroll through. Ctrl+n and Ctrl+p scans the last terminal for lines with common file:line
  patterns and jumps you to the file relative to the terminal directory.
- The authors need to work remotely, so the editor needs to be able to run in a terminal.
- It is fun learning how to make a text editor.
- Using something on a daily basis that we created gives us the warm and fuzzies.

### How To Build

#### Terminal Linux
- Requirements
  - c11 compiler
  - ncurses library

`$ make term`

#### Gui Linux
- Requirements
  - c11 compiler
  - SDL2

`$ make gui`

#### Gui Windows
- Requirements
  - c11 compiler
  - SDL2
  - SDL2_ttf
  - Visual Studio

Download SDL2 and split it up:
- Move the headers into external\include\
- Move the libraries into external\lib\
- Move the dlls into build/windows/

Then find Visual Studio's vcvarsall.bat, likely in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\... and update setup.bat to point to that.

`$ setup.bat`
`$ build.bat`

### How To Run
`$ ce path/to/file.c`

### How to configure
Build a shared object that implements these functions:
``` c
bool ce_init(CeApp_t* app){
     // initialize your config here
     return true;
}

bool ce_free(CeApp_t* app){
     // clean up your config here
     return true;
}
```

When running ce, pass it the path to the shared object  
`$ ce -c path/to/config.so`

See https://www.github.com/justy989/ce_config for an example configuration
